flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  generate: true # This enables flutter gen-l10n

  # ------------------- ASSETS DECLARATION -------------------
  # This tells Flutter to include the contents of the assets/fonts/ directory.
  # If you have other assets (like images), add their directories here too.
  # Example:
  # assets:
  #   - assets/images/z
  #   - assets/fonts/
  assets:
    - assets/fonts/ # This makes all files in assets/fonts/ available

  # ------------------- FONTS DECLARATION --------------------
  # This declares the NotoSansEthiopic font family and points to the
  # NotoSansEthiopic-Regular.ttf file as its primary (and only, in this scenario) asset.
  fonts:
    - family: NotoSansEthiopic
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSansEthiopic-Regular.ttf
          # You can optionally specify weight 400, but it's the default if it's the only one.
          # weight: 400

# flutter_gen configuration (if you use it for more than l10n).
# For standard l10n, `generate: true` above and your l10n.yaml are primary.
